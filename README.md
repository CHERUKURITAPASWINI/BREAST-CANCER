# Breast Tumour Classification using ML Models 
---


### Objective:
 This project aims to classify breast tumor biopsies as either benign or malignant using machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, SVM, and Neural Networks
 
### Project Overview:
1. Classifying Breast Tumour Dataset:
   
The dataset includes 569 biopsy reports, with 357 benign and 212 malignant cases. The goal is to accurately classify these reports based on the 'diagnosis' column, where 'M' represents Malignant and 'B' represents Benign. Key features are derived from 10 real-valued parameters computed for each cell nucleus, leading to 30 features per sample.

2. Model Accuracy Evaluation:
The project also focuses on evaluating the accuracy of these models in classifying the biopsy reports.

### Dataset Details:
The provided dataset consists of fine needle aspiration biopsy reports, aiding in diagnosing abnormal tissue or fluid conditions, such as cancer. Key features in the dataset include 10 real-valued parameters computed for each cell nucleus, encompassing attributes like radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension. These features were computed based on the mean, standard error, and the "worst" or largest values, resulting in a total of 30 features for each image.
